Overview:
---------

    -five classes:

           | instances     | class name
        -- +---------------+--------------------------
        1- | [1 total]     | RobotController (Robot Controller)
        2- | [1 each]      | Robot
        3- | [1 total]     | BZFSCommunicator
        4- | [1 per robot] | PersonalData
        5- | [1 total]     | EnvironmentData

    -RobotController manages the Robots
    -RobotController contains an instance of a BZFSCommunicator
    -RobotController and Robots communicate with bzrobots through the single communicator
    -Robots are in charge of their own potential field calculations
    -PersonalData is a container class for a Robot's personal data -- location,
        angle, speed, reloading bullets, etc., does its own parsing
    -EnvironmentData is a container class for a Robot's environment data --
        location of other tanks, bullets, obstacles, goals, etc


Slightly More Detailed:
-----------------------

  In general, the main controller is the RobotController.  This will communicate with
the bzrobots.  The RobotController will maintain a list/array of Robots.  The RobotController manages
what each of the Robots will do from a high-level perspective.  The RobotController
fetches information from the bzrobots about bullets, other tanks, his tanks,
and the environment and passes that information on to each of his Robots.
The RobotController class can contain an EnvironmentData object.  Each Robot will
have a pointer to this object and will also contain a PersonalData object.
Each Robot will update his/her :) PersonalData object when the RobotController
passes him updated data. Each robot in turn does the processing he needs
and replies back to the bzrobots through a reference to a BZFSCommunicator object.

  The RobotController is in charge of general strategies, and can tell each robot
to do specific tasks, such as getFlag(), guardBase(), attackOthers(), etc.
The RobotController can also tell it how aggressive to be (not-aggressive == avoid
enemies absolutely, aggressive == shoot at all enemies along the way
but keep charging [reckless]).

  Each Robot is in charge of it's own potential field calculations.  This
lets the RobotController tell each Robot to have different potential fields (aggression?).

  The BZFSCommunicator class is a class that is used to communicate with the
bzrobots.  The RobotController instantiates an instance of it and initializes it.  Each
Robot has a reference to the communicator.

  This is going to be single-threaded.

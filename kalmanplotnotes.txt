sigma-x
    this represents how much we trust the predicted x value (get the SigmaK value for the x POSITION)
sigma-y
    this represents how much we trust the predicted y value (get the SigmaK value for the y POSITION)
rho
    this represents (as per the course wiki: "rho(p) is the correlation btwn X and Y") ????
    need to ask in class exactly what to get this from, I'm not sure



------------

graphically speaking:
    -sigma-x is how wide the oval should be
    -sigma-y is how tall the oval should be
    -rho determines how much the oval is stretched

    might think of it like sigma-x and y are telling you how wide and tall to make the oval,
    as well as what the slope of the line should be (sigma-y/sigma-x).
    Rho tells you how much to stretch the oval along the slope.
